*  **feedback.md is for instructor use only. DO NOT change the feedback.md**; make a copy if needed
* class definition style & standards:  first, member vars  none per line and do not forget to initialize them;  second functions: separate group of functions  by a blank line; either matching setter/getter pairs or list all setters back to back and list all getters back to back; start with a default c’tor, followed by  copy c’tor (if any), then other c’tors in the order of increased number of arguments, d’tor- right after c’tor(s), overloaded functions- list them back to back in the order of increased number of arguments;  all accessor/getter functions should be const; all functions with more than one statement should be normal (defined externally, outside of the class and below main()), no inline functions with more than one statement; initialize all member variables to appropriate default values at the time of definition; all member variables must be private; classes must provide a strong exception guarantee; must have default c’tor; implement Rule of Three when necessary
* uses algorithm  and/or bits  libraries and/or break (Ok in switch) and/or go to and/or exit() in loop(s) and/or if(s) and/or empty return (e.g., return;) infinite loops (while(true) or similar); there is no situation where same effect cannot be achieved by a logical statement; in other words, there is no situation in this realm that cannot be described by using a combination of relational, comparison, and logical operators; you can always  write a loop condition to exit naturally when needed; see the syllabus – stopped grading
